# ☁️ India Air Quality Analysis (2020–2025) – Power BI Project

This project presents an end-to-end Air Quality Index (AQI) analysis for India using real environmental data downloaded from Kaggle. The dataset includes AQI values across multiple Indian cities from 2020 to 2025, along with pollutant information such as PM2.5 and PM10.

The project covers the full workflow:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing in Excel
- Date standardization and feature extraction (Year, Month)
- Power BI data modeling
- Multi-page dynamic dashboard creation

## 📊 Dashboard Pages

   High-level KPIs, AQI trend, polluted vs clean cities, category distribution.

2. **City Comparison**  
   City-wise AQI analysis with slicers for year, month, and category.

3. **Pollutant Insights**  
   PM2.5 and PM10 distribution, pollutant share, and related trends.

4. **Seasonality & Final Insights (Merged Page)**  
   Month-wise patterns, seasonal behavior, and key conclusions.
